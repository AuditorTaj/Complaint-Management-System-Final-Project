Complaint Management System

1. Overview
The Complaint Management System is initialized with Poetry and is designed using microservices architecture. The main components include FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, Streamlit for the frontend, Kafka for messaging, Kong for API Gateway, and Docker for containerization. Each service runs in its own container, orchestrated by Docker Compose.

2. Components
i.	 FastAPI: Handles user authentication, complaint management, and exposes RESTful APIs.
ii.	 PostgreSQL: Serves as the primary database for storing user and complaint data.
iii. Streamlit: Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the system.
iv.	 Kafka: Manages asynchronous messaging for complaints.
v.	 Kong: Acts as an API Gateway, providing security, load balancing, and rate limiting.
vi.	 Docker Compose: Manages the deployment and orchestration of all services.

4. Detailed Component Interactions
Frontend (Streamlit)
•	Provides the interface for users to sign up, log in, create complaints, and view complaints.
•	Interacts with the FastAPI backend through Kong API Gateway.
Kong API Gateway
•	Routes API requests from Streamlit to the appropriate FastAPI endpoints.
•	Implements security features such as authentication and rate limiting.
FastAPI Backend
•	Exposes endpoints for user authentication (/users, /token) and complaint management (/complaints).
•	Handles business logic for creating and managing complaints.
•	Communicates with PostgreSQL for data persistence.
•	Produces messages to Kafka for complaint-related events.
PostgreSQL Database
•	Stores user information and complaint details.
•	Uses encryption for sensitive data storage.
Kafka
•	Manages asynchronous processing of complaint-related messages.
•	Ensures reliable messaging and decouples complaint handling from immediate API responses.

5. Deployment with Docker Compose
The system is containerized using Docker, with Docker Compose managing the orchestration.

6. Security Considerations
Encryption
•	Use pgcrypto in PostgreSQL to encrypt sensitive data like passwords.
•	Ensure all sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials, secret keys) are securely managed using Docker secrets or environment variables.
Authentication and Authorization
•	Use JWT tokens for secure authentication.
•	Implement role-based access control if needed to manage different user permissions.
API Security
•	Use Kong to enforce rate limiting and protect against DDoS attacks.
•	Ensure all endpoints are protected with appropriate authentication mechanisms.
Data Security
•	Use encrypted volumes for PostgreSQL data storage to protect data at rest.
•	Ensure secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) between services.
